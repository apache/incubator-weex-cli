# Getting started

!> If you don't have node.js installed locally, you can go to [Nodejs official website](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download and install, and make sure your node version is `>=7.6.0`, you can use [n]( Https://github.com/tj/n) to perform version management of node.


## Installation

If you have problems during the installation process, you can do a question search and feedback at [here](https://github.com/apache/weex-cli/issues).

``` bash
$ npm install weex-toolkit -g
```

## Commands

### Create a project

```bash
# Create a project from the official template
$ weex create my-project
```

The `@weex-cli/generator` module uses [`download-git-repo`](https://github.com/flipxfx/download-git-repo) to download the template file. The `download-git-repo` tool allows You specify a specific branch and remote repository address for project download, and the specified branch is separated by the (`#`) symbol.

The template format under the download specific branch is as follows:
```bash
$ weex create '<template-name>#<branch-name>' <project-name>
```

E.g:

```bash
$ weex create weex-templates/webpack#v1.0 my-project
```

This command will initialize the project via the `v1.0` branch of the [weex-templates/webpack](https://github.com/weex-templates/webpack/tree/v1.0) project.

You can create project templates from official templates or remote sources, or you can create your own `weex` project templates. For more details you can see [How to create your own templates](https://github.com/weex-templates /How-to-create-your-own-template).
